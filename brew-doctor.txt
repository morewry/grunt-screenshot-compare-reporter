Please note that these warnings are just used to help the Homebrew maintainers
with debugging if you file an issue. If everything you use Homebrew for is
working fine: please don't worry and just ignore them. Thanks!

Warning: A newer Command Line Tools release is available.
Update them from Software Update in the App Store.

Warning: Broken symlinks were found. Remove them with `brew prune`:

Warning: "config" scripts exist outside your system or Homebrew directories.
`./configure` scripts often look for *-config scripts to determine if
software packages are installed, and what additional flags to use when
compiling and linking.

Having additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via
Homebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew provided
script of the same name. We found the following "config" scripts:

  /opt/local/bin/freetype-config
  /opt/local/bin/libpng-config
  /opt/local/bin/libpng16-config
  /opt/local/bin/Magick++-config
  /opt/local/bin/Magick-config
  /opt/local/bin/MagickCore-config
  /opt/local/bin/MagickWand-config
  /opt/local/bin/ncurses5-config
  /opt/local/bin/ncursesw5-config
  /opt/local/bin/pkg-config
  /opt/local/bin/python2.7-config
  /opt/local/bin/Wand-config
  /opt/local/bin/xml2-config

Warning: Your XQuartz (2.7.6) is outdated
Please install XQuartz 2.7.7:

Warning: You have MacPorts or Fink installed:
  /opt/local/bin/port

This can cause trouble. You don't have to uninstall them, but you may want to
temporarily move them out of the way, e.g.

  sudo mv /opt/local ~/macports

Warning: You have unlinked kegs in your Cellar
Leaving kegs unlinked can lead to build-trouble and cause brews that depend on
those kegs to fail to run properly once built. Run `brew link` on these:

    ruby

Warning: Your Homebrew is outdated.
You haven't updated for at least 24 hours. This is a long time in brewland!
To update Homebrew, run `brew update`.
